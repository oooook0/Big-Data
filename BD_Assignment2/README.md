# Assignment B

The assignment is divided into two parts:
- answer the following question using own logic:
  - By when (what year) will all bitcoins have been mined? And how many?
  - How many bitcoin spendable units are there currently? 
  - How does that compare with spendable units available in the world economy today? This is like asking: "could bitcoin be used as a global currency?"
  - What's the current size of the bitcoin blockchain? How quickly is it growing?
  - What does the blockchain verification cycle say about how quickly transactions can be verified?
  - What's the theoretical maximum transaction throughput of the bitcoin payments network?
  - What's the market capitalization of bitcoin as measured in US $ ?
- Write a simple program in Python using the blockchain.info "Blockchain Data API" that will sum up the total quantity of bitcoin transactions (how many bitcoins moved between addresses
in a 24 hour period) on any given day,
